# Smoking Health Risk Analysis Dashboard

Power BI Dashboard | Health Analytics | 2,500 Observations
#### Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Power BI health analytics dashboard designed to analyze smoking behavior and associated health risk factors across a population dataset of 2,500 observations. The dashboard enables users to explore relationships between smoking status, age, gender, and key health indicators, supporting data-driven health risk assessment and decision-making.

#### Tools & Technologies

Microsoft Power BI

Microsoft Excel (data cleaning and preparation)

Power Query (ETL)

DAX (measures and calculated metrics)

#### Dataset Overview

The dataset includes individual-level health records with the following variables:

Smoking status (Never, Current, Former)

Age group

Gender

Body Mass Index (BMI)

Cholesterol level

Hypertension status

Other health risk indicators

Each record represents one individual observation used to compute summary statistics and trends.

#### Data Preparation & Transformation

Data preparation was carried out using Excel and Power Query:

Cleaned missing and inconsistent values

Standardized variable categories

Created derived variables for analysis

Ensured data was structured and analysis-ready before modeling

DAX measures were created to compute:

Counts and proportions by smoking status

Risk factor distributions across age and gender groups

Summary health indicators for interactive filtering

#### Dashboard Design

The dashboard was designed for clarity and usability, featuring:

Interactive slicers for smoking status, age group, and gender

Clean layout to support quick insight discovery

Consistent color-coding for easy interpretation

Users can dynamically explore patterns and compare subgroups without technical knowledge.

#### Key Metrics & Visuals

Distribution of smoking status

Smoking patterns by age group and gender

BMI and cholesterol trends by smoking category

Hypertension prevalence across smoking groups

Comparative health risk indicators

#### Insights & Findings

Smoking prevalence varies significantly across age groups

Current smokers show higher concentration of certain risk indicators

Former smokers demonstrate different risk profiles compared to never smokers

Gender-based differences exist in smoking behavior and health outcomes

These insights support targeted health interventions and policy planning.

#### Use Cases

Public health research and reporting

NGO and health program monitoring

Health risk assessment and awareness campaigns

Academic and policy-focused analysis

#### Future Enhancements

Incorporation of additional clinical variables

Trend analysis over multiple years

Predictive risk modeling

Integration with real-time health datasets
